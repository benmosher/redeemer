Tiny utility to simplify batch scanning Marvel Unlimited codes. 


0. Save it to your home screen!
1. Open scanner
2. Point it at each code until acknowledged (shows "Last code: ...")
3. When all codes are scanned, click `REDEEM` on top to kick over to the redemption page, redeeming all scanned codes at once.

Practical limit of codes to scan at once: _unknown_
Current record: 2 (lol)
